# DevOps with Docker

The "DevOps with Docker" course, offered by Helsinki in partnership with Eficode, provides a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to Docker and container orchestration, with a focus on Docker Compose. It's designed for individuals with basic software development and command-line knowledge, aiming to build confidence in containerization and configuration for real-world use.

The course is divided into three parts:

1. **DevOps with Docker**: Learn Docker fundamentals, including images and containers, and how to build Docker images for existing projects.
2. **DevOps with Docker: docker-compose**: Master managing multi-container applications using Docker Compose and understand its role in orchestration.
3. **DevOps with Docker: security and optimization**: Learn to optimize Docker images for production, improve security, and explore advanced orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

While the course is text-based and includes hands-on exercises, it no longer offers certificate submission as the deadline was June 16, 2024.

# DevOps with Kubernetes

This introductory course to Kubernetes with K3s and GKE focuses on developing software with a microservice architecture that scales and deploys automatically using Kubernetes. Attendees will also learn to manage Kubernetes clusters and deployments.

**Prerequisites**: Prior experience with Docker and Docker Compose (via the "DevOps with Docker" course or equivalent) and familiarity with web software development (e.g., Full Stack Web Development) are required. Participants must also have admin/superuser privileges on their own computers to complete the exercises.

**Course Structure**:
- **Part 1**: Introduction to deploying, debugging, networking, and storage in Kubernetes.
- **Part 2**: Covers networking between pods, organizing clusters, configuring applications, StatefulSets, Jobs, and monitoring.
- **Part 3**: Focus on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), deployment pipelines, and GKE-specific features.
- **Part 4**: Delve into update strategies, Prometheus, messaging systems, and GitOps.
- **Part 5**: Kubernetes internals, custom resource definitions, service mesh, and what lies beyond Kubernetes.

This course provides a comprehensive guide to building and managing Kubernetes-based microservices applications.
